# Lastfm-analysis
The purpose of this project was to practice SQL on real world data. Music is one of my passions, so I decided to use the Last fm and Spotify API's to analyze some trends in the top artists over the past ten years

In this project, to get data I used the Spotify API and Last fm API. These API's allow for anyone to get large amounts of data on music, artists, songs, and albums. I decided to use Jupyter Notebook to display my analysis, in which I used python and pandas for data manipulation. I used the sqlite3 python package to write SQL queries against my data. I used the request package to call the last fm API.
